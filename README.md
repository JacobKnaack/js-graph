# Graph Data Structure

- Consists of Nodes/Vertices and Edges
  - Node / Vertex is an object containing a `value` and references to other Nodes.
  - Edge is a connection between nodes.
- Used to represent networks of interconnected objects.

## Implementation

Graphs consist of 2 key properties:

1. A finite set of vertices ( of type Node ).
2. A finite set of ordered pairs that denote connection between vertices ( Edges ).
